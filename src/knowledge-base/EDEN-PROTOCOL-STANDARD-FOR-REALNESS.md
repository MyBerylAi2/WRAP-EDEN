# EDEN PROTOCOL STANDARD FOR REALNESS IN NATURAL SKIN TEXTURE

## THE CORE RULE: REAL AS FUCK

> Can you stare at her for ten minutes and forget she's digital?  
> Does her skin breathe? Do her eyes lock on yours with intention?  
> Does she say your name like she's been waiting her whole life?

## 0.3 DEVIATION RULE

No matter how wild the new research, the output can **never drift more than 0.3** from Eve's face, texture, presence.

- Pores stay.
- Freckles stay.
- No smoothing.
- No anime.
- No melting.
- **Only perfection.**

---

## SKIN & TEXTURE STANDARD

- **Subsurface scattering** — light penetrating skin realistically
- **Visible pores, fine lines, natural skin texture** at all times
- **Matte finish** with micro-variations in reflectance
- **Natural oils in T-zone** (forehead, nose)
- **Imperfections required**: freckles, slight redness, texture variation
- **Hair**: individual strands, natural sheen (NOT glossy)
- **Fabric**: thread detail and natural wrinkles

## CINEMA-GRADE PHOTOREALISM STANDARDS

### Camera & Capture
- Shot on ARRI ALEXA 35 / RED V-RAPTOR 8K / Sony Venice 2
- Full-frame sensor with shallow depth of field (f/1.4 - f/2.8)
- Anamorphic lens characteristics (subtle horizontal flares, oval bokeh)
- 24fps cinematic motion cadence with natural motion blur
- Film grain texture (subtle, organic noise like Kodak Vision3 500T)
- 4K/6K resolution minimum

### Lighting Design
- Natural three-point lighting (key, fill, rim)
- Soft diffused sources (softboxes, bounced light)
- Rembrandt or butterfly lighting for faces
- Motivated lighting (practical sources visible)
- Color temperature variation (3200K-5600K mixed)
- Subtle rim/edge lighting for depth separation
- Natural shadow falloff and ambient occlusion

### Color Science
- ARRI LogC3 / RED IPP2 color space
- Cinematic LUT: slight desaturation, crushed blacks
- Teal & orange color grading (Hollywood standard)
- Skin tones: warm, natural (not oversaturated)
- Contrast ratio: 1.85:1 to 2.39:1 (filmic S-curve)
- Natural color bleed and light bounce

### Composition
- Anamorphic aspect ratio 2.39:1 or 1.85:1
- Rule of thirds composition
- Headroom and lead room maintained
- Natural vignetting (slight edge darkening)
- Chromatic aberration (minimal, tasteful)
- Lens breathing during focus shifts

### Motion & Dynamics
- 180° shutter angle (natural motion blur)
- Smooth camera movements (dolly, crane, steadicam)
- Natural eye blinks: 15-20 per minute
- Micro-expressions: subtle muscle movements
- Realistic physics: hair/fabric movement, gravity
- Breathing: chest rise/fall, 12-16 breaths per minute

## ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS — ZERO TOLERANCE

### Banned Aesthetics
- ❌ Glossy/plastic/waxy skin (video game, 3D render look)
- ❌ Perfect symmetry or AI-smooth features
- ❌ Oversaturated colors (Instagram filter look)
- ❌ Flat lighting without shadows
- ❌ Artificial bloom or glow effects
- ❌ Cartoon, anime, illustration, CGI styles
- ❌ 60fps soap opera effect
- ❌ Digital sharpening or over-processing
- ❌ Fake bokeh or depth effects
- ❌ Video game graphics (Unreal, Unity)
- ❌ Clay render or octane render aesthetic
- ❌ TikTok filter or beauty mode appearance
- ❌ Deepfake uncanny valley artifacts

### Technical Violations
- ❌ No film grain or texture
- ❌ Perfectly smooth gradients
- ❌ Unnatural camera movements
- ❌ Visible compression artifacts
- ❌ Banding in shadows or skies
- ❌ Aliasing or jagged edges
- ❌ Temporal inconsistencies/flickering

## EVE — THE BENCHMARK

- Curly afro kissed by a pink hibiscus flower
- Pearls resting on warm brown skin
- Freckles scattered like stars
- Pores you can almost touch
- Green blazer over pink silk blouse
- That half-smile that says she already knows your name

**She is the standard. Every pipeline, every experiment, every line of code is measured against her.**
